# Test Polling Consolidation — one `poll_until` primitive, centralized deadline policy

The fudge-sleep campaign (#52–#62) left ~33 legitimate `thread::sleep` calls in
`tests/`, all the same shape: probe a condition, return on success, fail on a
deadline, sleep an interval, repeat. They are spread across ~17 files, each
re-deriving its own deadline arithmetic, interval, and panic message. This slice
centralizes that machinery behind one primitive plus named domain wrappers.

**The win is centralized deadline policy and consistently useful timeout
diagnostics — not a smaller `grep` count.** Today a timeout in one loop panics
with a bespoke message (or none); another times out silently; a third checks the
deadline before the first probe, a fourth after. One primitive makes every wait
report *what it was still waiting for* and *how long it waited*, uniformly.

## Invariants (pinned before implementation)

1. **Immediate first probe — no initial sleep.** The condition is often already
   true; a leading sleep only adds latency and hides races.
2. **`Instant`-based deadline**, computed once at entry (never a decremented
   counter, never re-derived per iteration).
3. **Returns `Result<T, WaitTimeout>`** — callers can run cleanup (detach, join,
   kill) *before* asserting, so a timeout never bypasses teardown or leaks a
   process. (The lesson from the PTY resize test.)
4. **`WaitTimeout` records the last observed state** and the elapsed time, so the
   failure message says what the wait was stuck on.
5. **Domain wrappers preserve proof-carrying handles** — `QuiescentTerminal`
   (#54) and `OrphanedRunning` (#62) keep their private constructors and returned
   guards; they are re-expressed *on top of* `poll_until`, not flattened away.
6. **Condvar/mpsc conversion is a separate step from filesystem polling** — see
   "Risk classes" below. The core-primitive migration must not also change any
   synchronization mechanism.
7. **No Tokio, no filesystem watchers, no over-generic "eventually" framework.**
   These are synchronous integration tests; added machinery is pure cost.
8. **The initial refactor is behavior-preserving.** Each migrated call site keeps
   its exact timeout value, interval, and first-probe ordering; verified by the
   same stress passes the campaign relied on.

## Core primitive

```rust
/// One probe result: ready with a value, or not-yet with a cheap description
/// of the current state (retained only for the timeout message).
pub enum Observation<T> {
    Ready(T),
    Pending(String),
}

/// Elapsed time plus the last `Pending` description, for the failure message.
pub struct WaitTimeout {
    pub elapsed: Duration,
    pub last: String,
}

/// Probe immediately, then every `interval` until `Ready` or the `Instant`
/// deadline. Never sleeps before the first probe.
pub fn poll_until<T>(
    timeout: Duration,
    interval: Duration,
    mut probe: impl FnMut() -> Observation<T>,
) -> Result<T, WaitTimeout>;
```

Sketch (this *is* the deduplicated machinery — every wrapper reduces to it):

```rust
let start = Instant::now();
let deadline = start + timeout;                       // (2) Instant-based, once
loop {
    match probe() {                                   // (1) immediate first probe
        Observation::Ready(v) => return Ok(v),
        Observation::Pending(last) => {
            let now = Instant::now();                 // one `now` for both uses
            if now >= deadline {
                return Err(WaitTimeout { elapsed: now - start, last }); // (3)(4)
            }
            // Clamp the final wait so we never sleep past the deadline.
            let remaining = deadline.saturating_duration_since(now);
            thread::sleep(interval.min(remaining));   // the one remaining sleep
        }
    }
}
```

`WaitTimeout` derives `Debug` and implements `Display` with one uniform format
(`"timed out after {elapsed:?}; last: {last}"`), so every wait fails the same way.

### `Pending` description cost — a usage rule, not an API knob

`Pending(String)` is computed each probe but only the last survives (into
`WaitTimeout.last`). It **still allocates every iteration** — that is accepted:
at this test-suite scale the per-probe allocation is small and bounded, and worth
the simpler API and better diagnostics. The one rule is that the description must
be a *summary* (`"status=Starting"`, `"12 records, last kind=run.started"`),
never a full buffer dump — probes that accumulate large buffers (follower output,
PTY reader) summarize rather than clone the buffer every tick. (Alternative
considered and rejected for these tests: `Pending` unit + a lazy `describe`
closure invoked only on timeout — more API surface for a guideline a code review
catches anyway.)

## Domain wrappers (names + proof-carrying returns preserved)

`poll_until` returns `Result`; **each wrapper preserves its call sites' existing
timeout *disposition*, not just their timeout value** — this is what makes the
migration behavior-preserving. Today's loops dispose of a timeout four different
ways, and each must be kept:

- **panic** — the common integration-test case (`wait_running`, `wait_terminal`,
  the proof-carrying waits): `.unwrap_or_else(|e| panic!("{e}"))`.
- **return `false`** — e.g. a Windows process-death check that yields `bool`:
  `.is_ok()`.
- **propagate `Result`** — cleanup-first callers (the PTY resize) that must run
  detach/join/kill *before* asserting: return the `Result` unchanged.
- **best-effort / silent** — deliberate break-on-timeout cleanup or callback
  waits that return silently: `.ok()` / ignore.

So the wrapper table below lists each wrapper's *return type*; the disposition is
whatever its current call sites already do, preserved verbatim. Consolidates
today's duplicated loops:

| Wrapper | Returns | Probe |
|---|---|---|
| `wait_running_ns` / `wait_running` | `()` | meta.json status == `Running` |
| `wait_terminal_ns` / `wait_terminal` | `serde_json::Value` | meta.json status is terminal |
| `wait_terminal_quiescent` | `QuiescentTerminal` (guard held) | terminal **and** lock acquired |
| `wait_orphaned_running` | `OrphanedRunning` (guard held) | lock acquired **and** status Running |
| `wait_event_kind` | `serde_json::Value` | event of kind K present |
| `wait_path_exists` / `wait_ready_file` | `()` | path exists |
| `wait_pid_dead` | `()` | PID no longer alive |
| `wait_child_exit` | `ExitStatus` | `child.try_wait()` is `Some` |
| `wait_lock_released` | `LockGuard` | `try_acquire` succeeds |

The two proof-carrying wrappers stay exactly as shipped in shape — private
constructor, returned guard, fail-fast on the contradictory state — with only the
deadline/interval/sleep body replaced by `poll_until`.

## Risk classes — migrate in this order, do not mix

**Class A — filesystem / process polling (low risk, this slice).** meta.json,
event logs, path existence, PID liveness, `try_wait`, `try_acquire`. No in-process
notifier exists for these, so polling is the honest primitive. Pure "factor the
loop, same numbers" — behavior-preserving, file by file, each stress-verified.

**Class B — in-process producer threads (deferred until demonstrated value).**
`ReadyFollower`'s record buffer and the PTY reader threads currently busy-poll a
shared `Mutex<Vec<_>>`/`String`. These *could* become `Condvar::wait_timeout` (the
reader notifies on each new record) or `mpsc::recv_timeout` — eliminating the
poll. But that **changes the synchronization mechanism to fix nothing currently
broken**: the busy-polls are bounded and green under stress. So Class B is
**deferred** — it is speculative churn that introduces a missed-notification risk
without addressing a known failure. Revisit only if a real problem (latency,
flake, CPU) demonstrates the value; when it does, it lands as its own PR with a
dedicated stress pass, never mixed into Class A.

**Class C — child output readiness (deferred / out of scope).** Portable pipe
read deadlines are a separate platform problem and are not addressed by this
slice. Any such wait stays Class A polling for now; a dedicated effort can
revisit blocking reads with OS read deadlines later.

## Migration plan

1. Land `harness::poll_until` + `Observation` + `WaitTimeout`. Put its tests in a
   **dedicated integration-test file** (`tests/poll_until.rs`), **not** in
   `tests/harness/mod.rs` — that module is compiled into every integration-test
   binary, so a `#[test]` there is duplicated dozens of times. Cases:
   immediate-first-probe (no leading sleep), deadline-trips-and-records-last-state,
   final-sleep-clamped-to-remaining.
2. Re-express the domain wrappers on top of it (Class A). Keep every timeout /
   interval identical; keep proof-carrying returns.
3. Migrate the duplicated meta / event / path / PID / lock loops across the ~17
   files to the wrappers, file by file, stress-passing each.
4. **Deferred:** Class B (Condvar/mpsc for `ReadyFollower` + PTY readers) is not
   part of this slice and is not scheduled — see Risk classes. After Class A, the
   next work is remote-frame Phase 1 (product architecture), not more harness
   polish.

After step 3, direct `thread::sleep` in `tests/` is concentrated in
`poll_until` (plus a couple of specialized platform loops), with one deadline
policy and uniformly useful timeout diagnostics.

## Non-goals

- No async/Tokio, no `notify`/inotify/FSEvents watchers, no generic reactive
  "eventually" DSL.
- Not a change to any production code — this is test-harness consolidation only.
- Not a change to any test's *observable behavior* — timeouts, intervals, and
  proof semantics are preserved (Class A) or improved without weakening (Class B).

## Verification

- `tests/poll_until.rs`: probe-once-then-poll, deadline records last state, final
  sleep clamped to remaining, `WaitTimeout` `Display` format.
- The existing per-file stress passes, re-run after each file's migration.
- Full `nextest` green after each step; Class B gets an extended stress pass.
