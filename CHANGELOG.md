# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **PTY sessions have one input owner, attach takeover and an exact recording**
  ([#68](https://github.com/grumpydevorg/tendr/pull/68)). The sidecar decides who
  may write to a PTY: one human (`tendr attach`) or one agent (`tendr push`,
  `exec`) at a time. `tendr attach --takeover` supersedes the current holder,
  whose queued input is revoked. A slow viewer is disconnected instead of
  stalling capture. Every PTY session records its output and applied resizes
  exactly under `<session>/recording/<run_id>/` (up to 1 GiB per run; there is
  no opt-out yet). Attach sockets move to `~/.tendr/sockets` and both ends check
  the peer's user id.

- **`tendr prune NAME…` deletes finished sessions by name** ([#70](https://github.com/grumpydevorg/tendr/issues/70)).
  Names resolve in `--namespace`, or in `default`. Each goes through the same
  checks as `--all`, so a running or locked session is skipped, never deleted.
  A name that doesn't exist is reported as `not_found` and makes the command
  exit 1. Names can't be combined with `--all` or `--older-than`.

### Changed

- **Attaching to a PTY session needs the new attach protocol** ([#68](https://github.com/grumpydevorg/tendr/pull/68)).
  An older `tendr` cannot attach to a session started by this version, and this
  version reports a session started by an older sidecar instead of attaching.
- **`tendr push` to a PTY session is acknowledged.** It exits non-zero, with
  byte counts, when it is refused or its bytes are not all written; a second
  concurrent push is refused instead of interleaving. Pipe sessions are unchanged.
- **In `tendr attach`, `Ctrl-\` is an escape prefix:** `Ctrl-\ d` detaches and
  `Ctrl-\ Ctrl-\` sends one. `--escape none` turns it off.
- **PTY children start at 24×80** instead of 0×0, and a resize with a zero
  dimension is ignored.
- **`prune` removes orphaned attach sockets** left by a sidecar that was killed
  outright, and its summary gains `sockets_removed`.

### Fixed

- **`tendr attach` detaches when the session's program changes the keyboard
  encoding.** A child that enables the kitty keyboard protocol (as Claude Code
  can in Ghostty, kitty, WezTerm and foot) or xterm's `modifyOtherKeys` makes the
  terminal send `Ctrl-\` as an escape sequence rather than the `0x1c` byte, so
  `Ctrl-\ d` reached the child instead of detaching. Both encodings are now
  recognised, key releases, auto-repeat and modifier keys no longer interrupt
  the escape, and
  a doubled `Ctrl-\` is forwarded in the encoding typed.
- **`tendr attach` ended by a signal restores the terminal.** SIGHUP, SIGTERM
  and SIGINT now detach, restore the terminal and exit 1 with
  `tendr: attach ended by SIG…`, instead of leaving it in raw mode. Window
  resizes are forwarded on SIGWINCH as well as by the 100 ms size check.
- **`wait`, `kill` and `start --replace` report a session done only once its
  sidecar has released it** ([#91](https://github.com/grumpydevorg/tendr/issues/91)).
  The sidecar writes its final state just before releasing the session lock, so
  `prune` or `start --replace` run straight after `wait` or `kill` could find the
  session still locked (prune skipped it as `locked`). They now wait up to 2 s
  for the release. If it hasn't happened by then they warn on stderr and report
  the session anyway; exit codes are unchanged. `start --replace` of a session
  that had already finished did not wait for the release at all.
- **`exec` no longer hangs when a command's output doesn't end in a newline**
  ([#95](https://github.com/grumpydevorg/tendr/issues/95)). `exec shell -- printf foo`
  never returned, even with `--timeout`, and held the session's exec lock until
  the session died. The completion marker is now recognised at the end of a line.
- **`exec` on a POSIX shell no longer drops stderr written just before the command
  ends** ([#92](https://github.com/grumpydevorg/tendr/issues/92)). The frame now also
  prints a stderr end marker, and exec returns only once both it and the stdout
  sentinel are logged. If the session shell's stderr no longer reaches tendr
  (for example after `exec 2>/dev/null` was pushed to it), exec returns after
  one second with a warning that stderr may be incomplete. `tendr log` shows
  one extra `E` marker line per exec.

## v0.3.0 — Renamed to `tendr`

### Breaking changes

The project, crate and binary are renamed from Tender / `agenttender` /
`tender` to **`tendr`**. Nothing reads the old names, so this is a clean break:

- **Crate and binary:** `cargo install tendr` installs the `tendr` binary. The
  library is `tendr` (`use tendr::…`). Release archives are
  `tendr-<target>.tar.gz`. The `agenttender` crate stops at 0.2.1.
- **Repository:** `grumpydevorg/agenttender` is now `grumpydevorg/tendr`.
  GitHub redirects the old URL.
- **State root:** `~/.tender` → `~/.tendr` (sessions, callbacks, `lost+found`).
  There is no automatic migration and no fallback read of the old path.
- **Environment variables:** every `TENDER_*` variable is now `TENDR_*`
  (`TENDR_SESSION`, `TENDR_NAMESPACE`, `TENDR_RUN_ID`, `TENDR_GENERATION`,
  `TENDR_EXIT_REASON`, `TENDR_SESSION_DIR`, `TENDR_BLOCK_ID`,
  `TENDR_PARENT_EVENT_ID`, and the internal ready-pipe variables).
- **Script directives:** `#tender: key=value` is now `#tendr: key=value`.
- **Events:** internal sources are `tendr.sidecar`, `tendr.exec` and
  `tendr.cli`, and `tendr.` is the reserved source and kind prefix. Event logs
  written before the rename keep their `tender.*` sources.
- **Exec framing:** the in-band sentinels are `__TENDR_EXEC__` / `TENDR_EXEC_`,
  so `tendr exec` cannot drive a session started by the old binary.
- **Agent skill:** `using-tender` is now `using-tendr`; `tendr skill install`
  writes `.claude/skills/using-tendr/SKILL.md`, and the Nix package installs
  `share/agent-skills/using-tendr/SKILL.md`.
- **Nix:** the flake's package and check are `tendr` (`nix build .#tendr`).

### Cutover

Live sidecars from the old binary hold absolute paths into `~/.tender`, so move
the state root only once none are running:

1. Stop every session the old binary supervises (`tender kill <session>`), or
   let them finish.
2. `mv ~/.tender ~/.tendr`
3. Install `tendr`, remove `tender`, and update scripts, shebangs and callbacks
   that use `tender`, `TENDER_*` or `#tender:`.

### Added

- **`SidecarFailed`: the sidecar says when its own supervision failed.** A new
  exit reason (`"reason":"SidecarFailed","step":"<step>"`), a durable
  `run.sidecar_failed` event, exit code **5** from `wait`, `run` and `start`,
  and `TENDR_EXIT_REASON=SidecarFailed` for `--on-exit` hooks, which run for it.
  Exit code 3 (`SidecarLost`) still means the child may be running.

### Fixed

- **`tendr attach` on Windows says it is unsupported.** It failed with
  "attach socket not found", because only the Unix sidecar publishes the socket;
  it now reports "attach is only supported on Unix", as intended.
- **No spawned child is left running unsupervised.** Besides the lost `start`
  client fixed below, a failure after spawning could still end the sidecar with
  the child running: the `--stdin` transport, writing `Running`, the readiness
  meta rewrite, opening `output.log`, waiting for the exit, or a panic. Now a
  guard owns the child from spawn: steps that do not threaten the run recover
  with a warning (a failed `output.log` open drains the output so the child
  cannot block), and the rest stop the child and record `SidecarFailed`. A PTY
  session's attach socket is bound before the child is spawned, so a bind
  failure is `SpawnFailed` and a PTY session never runs without its listener.
- **Reconciliation kills a lost sidecar's orphan.** After a true crash
  (SIGKILL, OOM), `status`, `wait` and `run` found `SidecarLost` but left the
  child running forever. They now kill it, only after verifying its identity,
  and record `orphan_killed`. On the `--after` path the child is found through
  its `child_pid` breadcrumb. The cleanup of a session directory left without
  meta follows the same rule, so it no longer kills a process whose identity it
  cannot verify. Reconciliation now holds the session lock and re-reads meta, so
  it can no longer overwrite a record the sidecar wrote a moment earlier.

- **The sidecar survives losing its `start` client** ([#71](https://github.com/grumpydevorg/tendr/issues/71)).
  If the `tendr start` client died between the sidecar spawning the child and
  reading the readiness message (a closed pane, a killed tool call, Ctrl-C),
  the failed readiness write ended the sidecar and left the child running
  unsupervised: `status` later showed `SidecarLost`, with no `run.exited`, no
  further output and no `--on-exit` hooks. A failed readiness write is now a
  session warning (`readiness not delivered: start client gone`), and the run
  carries on to its normal terminal state.
- **A PTY session's `pty.control` no longer reverts to `AgentControl` while a
  human holds it.** Attaching flipped `meta.json` to `HumanControl`, but the
  sidecar's own later meta writes (a failed `output.log` open, the readiness
  rewrite, the terminal record) wrote back the `AgentControl` it started with,
  so `status` misreported the owner and `push` and `attach` skipped their early
  refusal (the sidecar still arbitrated the input itself). Those writes now
  carry the live owner.

## v0.2.1 — Security: reject option-shaped `--host` destinations

### Security

- **`--host` destination hardening.** The SSH destination is a bare positional
  argument to the local `ssh` binary, so an empty or option-shaped value (e.g.
  `--host '-oProxyCommand=<cmd>'`) could be parsed by the local ssh as an option,
  enabling **local command execution** when an untrusted value reaches `--host`.
  Tender now rejects empty or `-`-prefixed destinations at the CLI boundary
  (exit 2) and re-checks inside `exec_ssh` / `exec_ssh_frame` so no non-CLI
  caller can bypass it. Valid forms (`user@host`, ssh aliases, IPv4, bracketed
  IPv6) are unaffected. The vector was present in `v0.2.0` on both the general
  `--host` path and the `exec` frame path; exploitation requires an untrusted
  value reaching `--host`, so `v0.2.0` is not yanked.

## v0.2.0 — Agent Terminal Integration

The minimum credible release for reactive process supervision consumers like terminal UIs and agent orchestrators.

### New features

- **`--cwd` and `--env` on start** — child processes launch in the requested working directory with environment overrides. Inherited environment is preserved; overrides are additive.

- **`--namespace` on all commands** — sessions are grouped by namespace (`~/.tender/sessions/<namespace>/<session>/`). Default namespace is `"default"` when omitted. Two sessions with the same name can coexist in different namespaces.

- **`--on-exit` callbacks** — repeatable flag on `start`. Callbacks execute after terminal state is durable and the session lock is released. Callback results stored in `~/.tender/callbacks/<run_id>.json`, keyed by run_id (survives `--replace`). Six `TENDER_*` environment variables exported to callbacks.

- **`tender watch`** — multiplexed NDJSON event stream. Emits `run` and `log` events using the canonical event envelope. Flags: `--namespace`, `--events`, `--logs`, `--from-now`. Polling-based (100ms). Incremental log tailing. Status dedup. Broken pipe = clean exit.

### Architecture

- **Two state machines:** Run lifecycle ends at terminal meta.json write. Callbacks are a separate post-exit workflow, running after the session lock is released. `--replace` is no longer blocked by slow callbacks.

- **Canonical event envelope:** Frozen schema with fields `ts`, `namespace`, `session`, `run_id`, `source`, `kind`, `name`, `data`. Phase 2B emits `run` and `log` kinds from `tender.sidecar` source.

- **Platform trait extended:** `spawn_child` now accepts `cwd` and `env`. Windows skeleton compiles with the new signature.

### Tests

218 tests (up from 178 in v0.1.0). New coverage for namespace isolation, on-exit callbacks, watch event stream, boundary validation, env inheritance, and idempotency with cwd/env/namespace.

### Known limitations

- Watch is polling-based (100ms). Native filesystem backends (kqueue, inotify, ReadDirectoryChangesW) are a future optimization seam.
- Windows backend is signature-compatible but stub-only. Integration tests fail at spawn_child. 4 pre-existing session_fs test failures on Windows.
- No annotation events or `tender wrap` yet (planned for next release).
- No `tender prune` yet (planned for next release).
- Callback timeout is not enforced — a hung callback keeps the sidecar process alive.

## v0.1.0 — Core Local Supervision

Initial release. 8 CLI commands, Unix process supervision, crash recovery, idempotent start, log capture, stdin push, timeout enforcement.
