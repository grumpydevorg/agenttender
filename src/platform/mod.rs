//! Process-supervision backends — one [`Platform`] trait with a Unix and a
//! Windows implementation, selected at compile time as [`Current`].
//!
//! The trait hides every raw OS handle (PIDs, fds, Windows `HANDLE`s) behind
//! opaque associated types, so callers supervise children — spawn, contain,
//! observe, tree-kill, handshake readiness — without `cfg`-branching. Process
//! *observation* is the typed [`ProcessStatus`], never a boolean; lifecycle
//! *state* is owned by the sidecar, not decided here.
