//! Run-bound PTY input controller: who may write to a PTY, and what a write
//! acknowledgement means.
//!
//! This module is pure domain logic with no I/O of its own. The sidecar owns one
//! [`InputArbiter`] per run; the design is specified in
//! `docs/plans/active/00_cloud-pty-control.md` ("Controller state and the single
//! input writer").
//!
//! # States and transitions
//!
//! | From | Operation | Result |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Unowned { e }` | [`InputArbiter::claim`] | `Owned { e + 1 }` and a run-bound handle |
//! | `Owned { e }` | [`InputArbiter::claim`] | [`ControlError::Busy`]; state unchanged |
//! | any `{ e }` | [`InputArbiter::takeover`] | `Owned { e + 1, Human }`; the previous holder, if any, is returned for retirement |
//! | `Owned { e }` | [`InputArbiter::release`] with the current handle | `Unowned { e }` |
//! | any | [`InputArbiter::release`] with any other handle | [`ControlError::Stale`]; state unchanged |
//!
//! The epoch never decreases and every ownership change advances it by exactly
//! one. Advancing past `u64::MAX` is [`ControlError::EpochExhausted`], never a
//! wrap. A handle authorizes only while its run, epoch, and holder all match the
//! current `Owned` state, so a takeover invalidates every earlier handle, and a
//! released handle can never authorize again — a later owner has a larger epoch.
//! A different run's arbiter rejects the handle by run identity.
//!
//! # Serialized authorization and write
//!
//! Authorization and the PTY write happen inside one `&mut self` call,
//! [`InputArbiter::write_step`], and every ownership change also requires
//! `&mut self`. No takeover can therefore land between the check and the write:
//! exclusive access to the arbiter is the serialization point. Callers must not
//! split the two by authorizing with [`InputArbiter::authorize`] and writing
//! elsewhere. The sidecar keeps the arbiter in the single writer that also
//! applies ownership changes; the sink performs one nonblocking write attempt so
//! a child that is not reading input cannot delay a takeover.
//!
//! # Acknowledgements
//!
//! [`InputOutcome::Accepted`] means every byte of the request was written to the
//! PTY master. It does not mean the child consumed them or finished a turn.
//! [`InputOutcome::Incomplete`] reports exactly how many bytes were written
//! (possibly zero) and why the rest were not. Bytes already written cannot be
//! recalled; only the unwritten remainder is dropped.
